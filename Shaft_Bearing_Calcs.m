%% Design Variables
shaftRPM = thighAngularVelocity * 9.5493; %Converting rads/sec to rpm
Ka = 1.5; % Light impact application, picked value at top of range for safety
designLife = 40000; % Inbetween 8-hour service every working day (30000 hours) and continuous 24-hour service (50000 hours)

Lr = (9.6)*10^6; % Life corresponding to rated capacity

%% Determining fEquivalent
% The fEquivalent formulas below are for radial ball bearing since,
% Equation can be updated if we use an angular bearing instead
if ((fThrust/fRadial)<=0.35)
    fEquivalent = fRadial;
elseif ((fThrust/fRadial)>0.35 && (fThrust/fRadial)<10)
    fEquivalent = fRadial * ((1+1.115)*((fThrust/fRadial)-0.35));

end

%% Determining requiredC for the bearing application
requiredC = fEquivalent*Ka*((life/(Kr*Lr))^0.3); %calculate the requiredC to be compared with the chosenC of the bearing
% Doing so ensures the bearings we picked actually worked

%% Petroff's Equation
frictionCoefficient = 2*(pi^2)*((dynamicViscosity*shaftRPM)/(fRadial/(shaftRadius*bearingLength)))*(shaftRadius/radialClearance);

%% Friction Torque
frictionTorque = frictionCoefficient*fRadial*shaftRadius;

%% Energy Lost due to Friction
energyLoss = ((2*pi*shaftRPM)/60)*frictionTorque;

%% Radial Load life (not sure it can be used though)
%radialLoadLife = Kr*Lr*((chosenC/(fEquivalent*Ka))^3.33); % we can further prove our bearings work by determining it's life based on radial load
% doing so can show that the life of our bearing will be long enough
